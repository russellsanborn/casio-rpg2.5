Casio Calculate RPG Game

Myself (Russell Sanborn) and my friend, Nick Perry created this game with our High School Issues 10th grade trigonometry class casio calculators (1998). We modeled it after a current game called RPG. 

We ended up using all the memory of our Casio's.

This was one of the first programs I ever wrote.
