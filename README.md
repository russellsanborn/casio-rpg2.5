Casio Calculator RPG Game

Myself (Russell Sanborn) and my friend, Nick Perry, created this game with our high school 10th grade trigonometry class
Casio calculators (1998). We modeled it after a current game called RPG.

We ended up using all the memory of our Casio's.

This was one of the first programs I ever wrote.
